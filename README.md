#  Association Rule Mining on Prescription Data

##  Research Question

**What are the most common and clinically significant prescription combinations among patients based on historical prescription data?**

##  Project Overview

This project uses association rule mining to identify the most frequent and meaningful patterns in prescription data. The goal is to analyze historical records to uncover how certain medications are commonly prescribed together.

By applying market basket analysis techniques such as the Apriori algorithm and evaluating metrics like **support**, **confidence**, and **lift**, we can:

- Discover frequent itemsets of drugs.
- Understand clinically relevant co-prescription behaviors.
- Suggest opportunities to improve drug prescribing practices.
